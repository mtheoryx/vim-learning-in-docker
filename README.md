# Vim Learning in Docker

## Why is this here? 

- We want a docker image we can use to learn vim instead of using the vim on our machine.
- We want to experiment with vimrc and vimscripts in an isolated environment
- We want a way to either quickly share, or quickly destroy experiments
- We want to learn together.

## Where is the image?

The image can be found on Docker Hub (for now):

[Docker Hub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/mtheoryx/vim-docker)

[Github](https://github.com/mtheoryx/vim-learning-in-docker)

## What do we use?

### GIT via a base image

[alpine git](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/git)
